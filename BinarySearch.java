      becouse here a formula is applied when not founded case.  -(inserption point)-1=Output.
      Array    1  3  5  7  8  12  16  20
      Index    0  1  2  3  4  5    6   7
      Binary Seach Operation:- if searched element is greater than currect element move  to Right.
                               if searched element is less than currect element move to left.
                in above array binary search operation half the array and checks these cases okay.!
                when it half the array 7/2 = 3(takes absolute value).
                searched element is: 9
                3 is currect inserption.
                9 > 3 true move right
                index 3 and 7 calculated (7+(7-3))/2 = 5
                5 is currecr inserption 
                9 > 5 false
                9 < 5 true but not moves becouse it not matches so,
                now currect index(inserption) is 5
                place on that formula -(5)-1 = -6 is the output.

    /* bonus Tip
    we will also search an array at specific range
    Syntax :-
                  Arrays.binarySearch(arr, FromIndex, ToIndex, Key);            */
